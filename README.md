# How to Test
Clone repository locally and run "npm-install" inside of project repository to download all necessary node modules for local testing. 

You will also need to add an .env file to the project file with the API key for ChatGPT3-5. 

Once this is complete, run "npm run start:backend" to start the backend. If this is done correctly, your backend server should be running on port 8000. 

In a new terminal, run "npm run start:frontend" to start the frontend. If this is done correctly, localhost will open in your default browser with the web application.
